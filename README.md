# Chek

Chek is a minimalistic module preventing the need for heavier modules such as Lodash or Underscore.
The utility methods are designed for most use cases. They are not intended to handle every scenario.
If that is what's needed it is strongly suggested you use one of the afore mentioned libraries.

## When to Use

This library is best suited when you are perhaps creating a simple micro service in node and just need a way to perhaps extend some options or check if a variable is an object, plainObject, array etc. Really its purpose is to limit bloat not much more.
